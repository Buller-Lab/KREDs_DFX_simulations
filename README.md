# Biomass-derived Diformylxylose as a Renewable Solvent for Biocatalysis Applications

In this repository we provide the code that was used for MD simulations in diformylxylose (DFX) using OpenMM [1] and analysis of enzyme stability using MDTraj and EvoEF2.[2,3]

# Installation

We recommend to run this code on UNIX based systems such as Ubuntu. This repository can be downloaded to your local machine via the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Buller-Lab/KREDs_DFX_simulations
```
then navigate into the cloned repository with:
```bash
cd KREDs_DFX_simulations
```

this should only take a few seconds.

# System Requirements

## Hardware requirements

This code was developed and tested on the following hardware:

- CPU: AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3970X 32-Core Processor
- Memory: 130 GiB RAM
- GPU: 2x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090

## Software requirements
To create conda environments with necessary dependencies, run:
```bash
conda env create --file sim.yml
```
```bash
conda create -n cofolding_env python=3.11 -y
conda activate cofolding_env
git clone https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz.git
cd boltz
pip install -e .[cuda]
cd ..
```
```bash
conda env create --file clustering_env.yml
```
# Instructions for use
## The followings scripts are provided:
- pocket_analysis.py (identification of cavities and calculation of their dimensions based on pdb input)
- boltz2x_cofolding.py (Boltz-2 co-folding with 30 diffusion models per input yml)
- identify_centroid.py (Clustering of 30 Boltz-2 poses using ligand RMSD and determination of centroid of biggest cluster) 
## How to run the pocket analysis
Activate conda environment
```bash
conda activate pykvfinder_env
```
Run the pocket analysis (with default probe out and volume cutoffs)
```bash
python analyze_pockets.py 1W4T.pdb --probe_out 8.0 --volume_cutoff 50.0
```
```bash
python analyze_pockets.py 7QI3.pdb --probe_out 8.0 --volume_cutoff 50.0
```
## How to run the EvoEF2 energy calculation
Activate conda environment

```bash
conda activate evoef2_env
```
Navigate in working directory
```bash
 cd ddG_calc
```
Clone EvoEF2 repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tommyhuangthu/EvoEF2.git
```
Make EvoEF2 build executable
```bash
chmod +x build.sh
```
Install EvoEF2
```bash
bash build.sh
```
Run the energy calculation if the input folder in one batch generating results in the output folder
```bash
python EvoEF2_batch.py --input_folder EvoEF2_inputs --output_colder EvoEF2_outputs
 
```

## How to run the MDTraj & scikit-learn clustering to derive a representative conformation
Activate conda environment
```bash
conda activate clustering_env
```
Run the clustering (with input and output folder specified; only one example is shown and path needs to be adapted for the other variants)
```bash
python identify_centroid.py --input_folder boltz_results_05PaAT_chimera_Substrate/predictions/05PaAT_chimera_Substrate --output_folder centroid_05PaAT_chimera_Substrate
```
